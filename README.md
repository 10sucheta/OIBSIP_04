Responsive Login Authentication This is my fourth project for my internship at Oasis Infobyte, where I created a responsive Login page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This login page offers a modern and engaging user experience with its sleek design and responsive layout. It features separate forms for login and signup, each with intuitive input boxes, labels, and icons. JavaScript is used to handle form submissions, checking for existing users during signup and verifying credentials during login. Success messages are displayed, providing clear feedback to users.  The design uses a combination of colors, gradients, and animations to create an attractive user interface. Overall, the page provides a user-friendly interface for authenticating users, making it easy for them to access their accounts.
